## ERHS 535 Final Project: Alex Alon, Owen Bevis, Arielle Glass, Susan Gogolski

### Introduction

This project leverages the **Nuclear Explosions Dataset** sourced from the [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://www.sipri.org/) and tidied via the [rfordatascience](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-08-20) TidyTuesday repository. The analysis focuses on exploring nuclear explosions by country, deployment methods, regions, yield, and purpose over time using both static and interactive visualizations.
