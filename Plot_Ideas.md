Ideas for Plots:


1. 

World Map with Point for Each Period (dot plot and bar graph)
  a.years grouped by event and faceted
      - World War II
      - Cuban Missle Crisis
      - Vietnam War
      - Korean War
      - Post Cold War
  b.supplemental bar graph for number of bombs per period
  

2. World Map of All Bombs (dot plot)
  a. shows all bombs for all years
  b. color code points by country
  c. maybe size by avg yield or something
  d. interactivity
      - can click on a country to zoom in at the points
      - have geom text show name, year, etc...
  
3. Top 10 Bombs
  - show box plot with error bars being low and high yield
  - show name of them
  
4. Bar Plots for Number of Bombs in Different Contexts
  - by country
  - by target region
  - by purpose
  - by type
  - will need to use gridextra package to combine these plots
  
5. Purpose Over Years
  - faceted by country
  - would be ridge density plots
  - get counts of different purposes grouped by country
