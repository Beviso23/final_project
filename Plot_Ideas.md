Ideas for Plots:


1. 

World Map with Point for Each Period (dot plot and bar graph)
  a.years grouped by event and faceted
      - World War II
      - Cuban Missle Crisis
      - Vietnam War
      - Korean War
      - Post Cold War
  b.supplemental bar graph for number of bombs per period
  

2. World Map of All Bombs (dot plot)
  - shows all bombs for all years
  - color code points by country
  - maybe size by avg yield or something
  
3. Top 10 Bombs
  - show box plot with error bars being low and high yield
  - show name of them
  
4. Bar Plots for Number of Bombs in Different Contexts
  - by country
  - by target region
  - by purpose
  - by type
  - will need to use gridextra package to combine these plots
  
5. Purpose Over Years
  - faceted by country
  - would be ridge density plots
  - get counts of different purposes grouped by country
